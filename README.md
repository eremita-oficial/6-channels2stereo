## 6-channels2stereo.sh

Bash script to CONVERT and NORMALIZE AUDIO from video files, 6-channels (5.1) into Stereo, recursively.

That script identifies video and audio format of given file and converts it ONLY IF NECESSARY. This saves time.

It also has the option to NORMALIZE the files KEEPING the original audio channels (5.1 etc.)
